# Use library corehunter
```{r}
library(corehunter)
```

# Import data
Use SNP biparental type format of input data.
```{r}
my.data <- genotypes(file = "/home/dang/tomato/test3/corehunter/i2.i3.samples.snps.core.txt", format = "biparental")
```

# Do core collection!
Collect 10% of total samples as a core. Use EN-E 0.3 and AN-E 0.7 to compute the metrix.
```{r}
core <- sampleCore(my.data, size=0.10, obj=list(objective("EN", "MR",
weight=0.3),objective("AN", "MR", weight=0.7)), verbose=TRUE)
core
```
